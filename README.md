# Description
A series of exercises and mini-projects that I'm doing as I learn how to use PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning.

## Convert Microsoft Learn PyTorch Tutorial to Lightning Architecture
Microsoft Learn has a short tutorial on PyTorch that can be found here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-machine-learning-pytorch/?WT.mc_id=aiml-7486-cxa. It trains a simple multilayer perceptron on the MNIST dataset. I converted the code to conform to the Lightning interface in order to become more familiar with both PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning. classifer.py contains the model class. dataModule.py contains the data module class. main.py fits the network to the data. 

## Implement a simple generative adversarial network (GAN)
WIP.
